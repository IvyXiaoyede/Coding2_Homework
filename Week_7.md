# Week7_Readme

For this class assignment I focused on understanding how to do some databasing of images, the database I used was a local database, the first step was to convert the image data into a series and randomly pull any image, here I pulled the 10th image and greyed out the image.
I also tried averaging the data from 10 images to form a new image. The images were also charted to form a series of bar charts.
